# Submarine Game
A game I am making becauase, as it turns out, I have no game that I own. Thus, this will be a showcase of my gamedev skills.

### Goals
- A good core loop. 
- 50 levels.
- Showcase my coding skills? (idk if this game will have very complex systems. We'll see. Rn, it is all about finishing.)
- Well integrated analytics and monetization pipeline. 
- Release on Android. 
- Acquire 10k Users(ik its overkill but it'd be cool.)
- Apply for IGDC SGOTY. 

### YouTube
- I am streaming this development on YouTube, I don't talk much but you can watch me struggle(jk) here: [Watch.](https://youtube.com/AayushChaudharyGames)
